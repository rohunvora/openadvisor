# OpenAdvisor Disclosure Compliance Guide

## 📋 Quick Compliance Checklist

✅ **Always disclose** when you have received or will receive tokens  
✅ **Use clear language** like "Paid partnership" or "I'm an advisor"  
✅ **Place disclosures prominently** - not buried in comments  
✅ **Update regularly** as vesting occurs  
✅ **Keep records** of all advisory relationships

## 🚨 Why Compliance Matters

### Legal Requirements

1. **SEC Section 17(b)** - Makes it illegal to promote securities without disclosing compensation
2. **FTC Guidelines** - Require clear disclosure of material connections
3. **Penalties** - Up to $50M+ in fines, criminal charges possible

### Real Examples of Enforcement

- **Kim Kardashian**: $1.26M fine for not disclosing $250k payment
- **DJ Khaled & Floyd Mayweather**: Settled charges for ICO promotion
- **Multiple influencers**: Received warning letters from FTC

## 📝 How to Disclose Properly

### Twitter/X Posts

#### ✅ GOOD Examples:

```
"Excited about @ProjectXYZ's launch!

Disclosure: I'm an advisor and hold tokens 🤝"
```

```
"[AD] Proud to advise @ProjectXYZ on their tokenomics.
The team is shipping fast!

#PaidPartnership"
```

#### ❌ BAD Examples:

```
"Check out @ProjectXYZ - going to moon! 🚀"
(No disclosure)
```

```
"Love this project!

PS: advisor"
(Disclosure buried and unclear)
```

### Best Practices by Platform

#### Twitter/X

- Use hashtags: #Ad, #PaidPartnership, #Advisor
- Put disclosure in main tweet, not replies
- Can use Twitter's paid partnership tool

#### Discord/Telegram

- Add "Advisor" to your display name
- Disclose in your first message about the project
- Pin disclosure in relevant channels

#### YouTube/Podcasts

- Verbal disclosure in first 30 seconds
- Written disclosure in description

#### Blog Posts/Articles

- Disclosure at the beginning, not end

- Repeat for long-form content

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Hidden Disclosures**

❌ Burying in long threads  
✅ Clear, upfront, unmissable

### 2. **Vague Language**

❌ "I work with them"  
❌ "Partner"  
❌ "Involved with"  
✅ "Paid advisor"  
✅ "I receive tokens"  
✅ "Compensated promoter"

### 3. **Timing Issues**

❌ Disclosing after the pump  
❌ Deleting old promotional posts  
❌ Retroactive disclosures  
✅ Disclose BEFORE promoting  
✅ Keep records of all posts  
✅ Update as status changes

### 4. **Selective Disclosure**

❌ Only disclosing on some posts  
❌ Different rules for different platforms  
❌ Assuming followers "know"  
✅ Every post needs disclosure  
✅ Consistent across platforms
