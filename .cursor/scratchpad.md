# OpenAdvisor Platform - Multi-Agent System Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

OpenAdvisor is a transparency-first platform designed to solve the opacity and compliance issues in crypto advisor deals. The platform enables:

- **KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders)**: Accept token grants on Solana with automatic compliance and disclosure
- **Projects**: Issue standardized, auditable token grants without manual legal processes

Key Problems Being Solved:

1. Regulatory compliance fears (SEC §17(b), FTC disclosures)
2. Manual, slow deal flow through back-channels
3. Lack of transparency undermining community trust
4. No standardized process for advisor agreements

**V1 Simplification**: Focus on KOL signup and transparent deal tracking without vesting complexity. Vesting will be added in v2.

## User Journey (v1 - Simplified)

### KOL Journey

1. **Discovery**: KOL learns about OpenAdvisor through project invitation or marketing
2. **Onboarding**: Clicks "I'm a KOL" → Connects Twitter → Signs wallet verification
3. **Profile Creation**: Creates public profile showing advisor status
4. **Deal Visibility**: All accepted advisor deals are publicly visible on their profile
5. **Compliance**: Platform provides clear disclosure guidelines and templates

### Project Journey (v2 - Future)

- Projects will be able to create offers and track deals
- For v1, focus is entirely on KOL experience and transparency

## User Stories (v1)

### KOL Stories

- As a KOL, I want to connect my Twitter and wallet in under 60 seconds so I can create my advisor profile
- As a KOL, I want a public profile page showing all my advisor relationships for transparency
- As a KOL, I want clear disclosure guidelines so I stay compliant
- As a KOL, I want to manually log my advisor deals to build trust with my community
- As a KOL, I want a verification badge showing I'm committed to transparency

### Executor Update - Twitter OAuth & Leaderboard Complete ✅

Successfully implemented Twitter OAuth sign-up and leaderboard functionality:

**Backend (API)**:

- ✅ Twitter OAuth 1.0a strategy configured with Passport.js
- ✅ User creation/update on Twitter sign-in
- ✅ JWT token generation for sessions
- ✅ User directory endpoint with latest signups first
- ✅ Health check endpoint shows configuration status

**Frontend (Web)**:

- ✅ Empty state when no users signed up

**Documentation**:

- ✅ Created comprehensive TWITTER_OAUTH_SETUP.md guide
- ✅ Includes callback URL configuration
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Production deployment instructions

### 🚀 Required Setup Steps

To make Twitter OAuth work, you need to:

1. **Configure your Twitter App** at developer.twitter.com:

   ```
   Callback URL: http://localhost:8080/api/auth/twitter/callback
   Type: Web App
   Permissions: Read
   ```

2. **Add to your .env file**:

   ```bash
   # Twitter OAuth (from your Twitter app)
   TWITTER_API_KEY=RFI5MXJwdXVOT01VNnZDZ1o5Z1M6MTpjaQ
   TWITTER_API_SECRET=KJsHm7zTdOy_MoxKCQOo5_vWIjTBt4uUrJ8HWLsjhT5hQUcQ7d

   # JWT Secret (generate a secure one for production)
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_change_this_in_production

   # URLs
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   TWITTER_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/twitter/callback
   ```

3. **Create frontend env file** `apps/web/.env.local`:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

4. **Test the flow**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Sign in with Twitter"
   - Authorize the app
   - See yourself in the leaderboard!

### 📝 How the Leaderboard Works

1. **Latest First**: Users ordered by signup time (newest at top)
2. **Profile Info**: Shows Twitter profile image and name
3. **Verification Badge**: Blue Twitter icon for OAuth users
4. **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes when new users sign up
5. **Empty State**: Shows call-to-action when no users

### 🔍 Testing Endpoints

- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/api/health
  - Shows if Twitter OAuth is configured
  - Shows if JWT is configured
- **User Directory**: http://localhost:8080/api/users/directory
  - Returns list of signed-up KOLs
  - Public endpoint (no auth required)

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"Twitter sign-in hit a snag"**:

   - Check TWITTER_API_KEY and TWITTER_API_SECRET in .env
   - Verify callback URL matches exactly
   - Make sure Twitter app is active

2. **Users not showing in leaderboard**:

   - Check API is running (port 8080)
   - Verify database connection
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **"Cannot read property 'replace'"**:
   - Database migration issue with drizzle-kit
   - Tables were already created, so ignore this

### ✅ What's Working Now

## Lessons

- Always include debugging info in program output
- Read files before editing them
- Run security audits (npm audit) when vulnerabilities appear
- Ask before using git --force commands
- For LLM-powered features, provide rich context over rigid templates
- Simplify scope for v1 - vesting and complex features can wait
- Tailwind v4 uses @tailwindcss/postcss instead of traditional config
- For Vercel monorepo deployment, specify the root directory as apps/web
- **@fastify/cookie must be registered before @fastify/session in plugin order**
- **TypeScript errors in packages don't always block development - focus on critical path**
